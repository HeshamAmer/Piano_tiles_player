# Piano_tiles_player
This is a game project i've been having fun on. It was really fun to make and it feels great just to watch the computer play
The project target is to play this new game called piano tiles using screen as input.
I've chosen this website as the host he'll be hosting the game http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/.
You need to position the web-page in a position identical to the image "Screen position"; that is in the top left corner of the screen with some positioning of the game to match the screen.
Choose the Relay mode and watch it play, my latest attempt reached 600 tiles then i got bored and closed it.
It reaches on average 120 on the Arcade mode.
Hope you enjoy it.
